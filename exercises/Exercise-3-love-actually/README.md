# Exercise 3: Love, Actually - Find your True Love Edition

Link: https://crystals80.github.io/cart253/exercises/Exercise-3-love-actually/

This is an exercise to practice my understanding of functions and how to use/apply them in Javascript p5.js.

The inspiration for this piece is relationships. I basically made an upgrade from Pippin's <i>Looking for Love</i> tutorial and added more interesting movements to make it more dynamic.

The overall experience in terms of coding the movements, testing it out and witnessing the interactive result is very satisfying, despite the fact that I ran into so many issues about why my shapes didn't show on the canvas, didn't want to move or just glitch somehow. So a lot of debugging was done and man it was really stupid syntax errors ಠ╭╮ಠ

Otherwise, I appreciate the exercise and I like how the "people" figures moves in a squiggly way (using noise) trying to meet its significant other (or not), in contrast to the straight-forwardness of the user's movement using keyboard arrows. I thought of adding a very distinctive identity to the user and significant others and so the result shows the shape of the square and ellipses being one more geometric than the other more organic, which marks the individuality.

Thank you for playing the "game" and for (trying to catch the significant other and to get a happy ending)! "\ (•◡•) /"
