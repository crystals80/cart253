# Exercise 5: Juggle Garden - Prize or No Prize

Link: https://crystals80.github.io/cart253/exercises/Exercise-5-juggle-garden/

This is an exercise to practice my understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) and how to use/apply them in Javascript p5.js.

The inspiration for this piece is children's playground and mindset. I basically made an upgrade from Pippin's <i>Juggling Object-Oriented Programming</i> tutorial and added more interesting visuals and context making it more dynamic.

The overall experience in terms of coding the movements, testing it out and witnessing the interactive result is very challenging. I ran into many issues about display the properties on the classes, as I am trying to understand OOP even though I'm struggling with it for now.

Another issue is the audio/sound. It sometimes plays over and over and other times not at all. So I had to spend a lot time of debugging it, which caused me to forgot to display certain aspects of it like the side wall paddles.

Things I would like to improve:

1- The score should grow only when the balls hit the paddles (trampoline and wall paddle).
2- And so the previous point would then allow me to change the score system to a maximum of 15 points.
3- I would like to make the sound play only when the ball bounce on any of the thre paddle.
4- How to do states with classes????
5- Have a better understanding of OOP because I am still far from debugging it well on my own.

Otherwise, I appreciate the exercise and I find it useful as I learn more about complex coding

Thank you for playing the "game" and for (trying to keep the balls on screen)! "\ (•◡•) /"
