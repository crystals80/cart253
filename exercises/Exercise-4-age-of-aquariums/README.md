# Exercise 4: Age of Aquarium - A Shark on Diet

Link: https://crystals80.github.io/cart253/exercises/Exercise-4-age-of-aquarium/

This is an exercise to practice my understanding of arrays and how to use/apply them in JavaScript p5.js.

The inspiration for this piece is fishes in a gigantic aquarium. I basically made an upgrade from Pippin's <i>introduction to arrays</i> tutorial using the concept of fishes moving in a limited space and added more interesting interactions to make it more dynamic.

The overall experience in terms of coding the movements, testing it out and witnessing the interactive result is very satisfying, despite the fact that I ran into so many issues about why my fish images didn't show on the canvas.

Another issue is a bug in which there are 2 remaining fishes that cannot be removed by a mouse click no matter what and it even says error in the console but there is no error in my code (not for me anyway...). So a lot of debugging was done and man it took me way too long to debug ಠ╭╮ಠ

One thing I would like to improve is having the fishes and shark change their body direction (like flip the image when they move to the left since some of them are faced to the right, vice versa). But I imagine that conditionals need to be coded for that, but I don't know how since I'm still fairly new in using arrays and images in coding. Another thing I would like to improve is to fix the 2-remaining-fishes bug, and finally I would like to add an ending screen once all the fishes has been eaten.

Otherwise, I appreciate the exercise and I like how the fish figures moves in a squiggly way (using array and random movements) swimming its way through the aquarium (or not), and I guess this ending where the shark can no longer eat anymore fish is funny because maybe he's on a diet or just got bored of eating the same fishes hahaha

Thank you for playing the "game" and for (trying to feed the fellow shark)! "\ (•◡•) /"
