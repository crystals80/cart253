# Exercise 6: Make some Noise

Link: https://crystals80.github.io/cart253/exercises/Exercise-6-make-some-noise/

This is an exercise to practice my understanding of sound and how to use/apply them in Javascript p5.js by going through the p5 sound library.

The inspiration for this piece is to be creative with whatever that is proposed. I basically made an upgrade from Pippin's <i>Musical Toy</i> tutorial and added more interesting visuals and sound making it more dynamic.

The overall experience of coding sound was very challenging as it is not something I will explore in my final project. It is still quite difficult for me to understand the material on coding sound. So I am trying to experiment the basics with imagery

For improvement, I guess it would be to understand p5 sound and its functions better through experiments. So I need to experiment more with p5 sound in order to improve.

Otherwise, I appreciate the exercise and I find it useful as I learn more about complex coding involving sound, audio-in and such

Thank you for drawing sound and for trying to keep your eardrums safe from the randomized and chaotic sound! "\ (•◡•) /"
