# Exercise 2: Dodge'em - Microscopic Edition

Link: https://crystals80.github.io/cart253/exercises/Exercise-2-dodge-em/

This is an exercise to practice my understanding of conditionals and how to use/apply them in Javascript p5.js.

The inspiration for this piece is COVID-19. I basically made an upgrade from Pippin's <i>Dodge COVID-19</i> tutorial and added more interesting visuals and movements making it more dynamic.

The overall experience in terms of coding this art piece, testing it out and witnessing the interactive result is very satisfying and pleasant to play this "game". I like how the COVID figures moves in a squiggly way trying to catch the user as well as the contrast between those moving in a straight line across the window page and the former (squiggly moving) figures.

Thank you for playing the "game" and for (trying to avoid and) staying safe and away from the COVID figures! \ (•◡•) /
