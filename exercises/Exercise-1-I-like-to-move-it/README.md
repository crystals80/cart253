# Exercise 1: I like to move it!

Link: https://crystals80.github.io/cart253/exercises/Exercise-1-I-like-to-move-it/

This is an exercise to practice my understanding of variables and how to use/apply them in Javascript p5.js.

The inspiration for this piece was epilepsy and I wanted to use changing colours and (simple) shapes to create a chaotic moving picture. Yet, I still want the overall to look aesthetic because it is a value I look and pursue in my design, artworks and projects.

There was a Javascript object with a cool effect (the very last one in the Vertex link of p5 Reference) that I wanted to add in but I couldn't since it would mess up the composition of what is going on in this Javascript file, and I couldn't find a way to fix it and eventually incorporate it into my composition. Therefore, after debugging for 3h, I gave up and save it for the upcoming exercises when I'll have more insights on Javascript.

That was the biggest challenge. Otherwise, I enjoyed it! I was trying to interpret a sort of confusion happening to the state of the mind, where brain cells send signals rapidly and chaotically to response, acknowledge and fix the confused state of mind, and all of this is interpreted in a very abstract ways since I couldn't figure out many functions, properties or reference to personalize in a limited time.

Thank you for your patience!
