# Project 1 - Simulation

This is the README file for the entire project. For more official projects you should write information here about the nature of the project, your name, any special explanations of how the project works, etc.

This is a simulation project to practice my understanding of Javascript variables, conditionals and functions as well as how to code them using p5.js library. Basically, a project that encompasses materials that I have learned about Javascript until now, excluding Arrays (explanation further below).

The inspiration for this piece is a mental health simulator, but a bit different from all the conventional things one imagine when "mental health" is mentioned. In other words, I wanted to create a simulator for users to relax, de-stress and have fun by drawing.

<b>How the simulation works:<b>

1-Enjoy the view
2-Enjoy another view, if you want as it tests your patience
3-Draw a kaleidoscope
4-If you're not satisfied with your kaleidoscope, clear and restart
5-Wait for CPU to generate its piece of art
6-To your satisfaction, wait a bit more or restart the automated drawing
7-Click save to download an image of both artworks
8-Enter final phase of simulator for praise

The overall experience in terms of coding this art piece, testing it out and witnessing the interactive result was very (and I mean VERY) challenging as the simulation that requires the user's input requires knowledge on arrays. However, I have yet to discover what arrays do, so I had a bit of help from Sabine the C-Lab Tech to help me code the simulation and to briefly explain what arrays are before I can learn them in class.

Nonetheless, it was very satisfying and pleasant to see that the simulation works and to make your own artwork. I like the interactive circles bouncing from a wall to another as well as the floating circles from bottom to top of the canvas. Drawing the kaleidoscope requires a tad bit of control in terms of moving the mouse to draw the dots or lines but it was very satisfying to see the final result (and the result you want) of the kaleidoscope drawing. As for the automated line drawing, it was entertaining to observe what it will do next and the imagery that it creates is very intriguing as the lines were drawn in a random order.

Despite being satisfied with my coding, there are a few things I would like to improve.

1- I would like to make the lines draw rectangle every time it draws (but this is just my preference, though I'm satisfied with the unexpected imagery).
2- I would like the automated drawing to draw a different coloured line each time a line is drawn (this requires further array or Javascript knowledge).
3- I would make the ending state more interactive by painting the whole screen using pointillism of an image (inspiration found on p5.js Examples page -> https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html <- I'm planning on copying the code but I want to code something similar as I find the effect it does very cool and interesting).
4- I would like to arrange my code more neatly for legibility, once I learn about arrays and other Javascript knowledge to make my code less lengthy.


Thank you for taking your time to make your own artwork using the simulator, for being patient and for taking the time to read my notes! "\ (•◡•) /"
