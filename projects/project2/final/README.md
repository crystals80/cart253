<b>Artist Statement</b>

<b><i>A Delightful and Wondrous Underwater Odyssey</i></b>

A Delightful and Wondrous Underwater Odyssey is an underwater simulation that is composed of three playful mini games representing challenges to be part of the ocean and live in symbiose with the beautiful sea creatures. These challenges requires one to feed a hangry shark, to reach a destination through a fishy traffic and to evade a flock of predators.

Accordingly, I envision an amusing and enjoyable simulation that allows users to have fun engaging in the mini games. I also wish for the user to ease up releasing any physical or mental tension they are enduring. Another way to express my work's approach is that I wish to carry users to another world where they can be enchanted by it and feel at peace.

In creating this pleasant and entertaining simulation, I hope for users to interact with a simple gaming system and to use it as a service that help them alleviate their stress and built-up anxiety. Thus, I aimed for a minimalist, cute and aesthetically pleasing visuals in order to create this simulation. I also use a stylized typeface, Playfair Display, to offer a sense delicacy. Not to mention, I decided to incorporate a few serene and playful background music inspiring users to achieve a wholesome experience.
