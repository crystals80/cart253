<b>Artist Statement</b>

<b><i>A Delightful and Wondrous Underwater Odyssey</i></b>

A Delightful and Wondrous Underwater Odyssey is an underwater simulation that is composed of three playful mini games representing challenges to be part of the ocean and live in symbiosis with the beautiful sea creatures. These challenges requires one to feed a hangry shark, to reach a destination through a fishy traffic and to evade a flock of predators.

Accordingly, I envision an amusing and enjoyable simulation that allows users to have fun engaging in the mini games. I also wish for the user to ease up releasing any physical or mental tension they are enduring. Another way to express my work's approach is that I wish to carry users to another world where they can be enchanted by it and feel at peace.

In creating this pleasant and entertaining simulation, I hope for users to interact with a simple gaming system and to use it as a service that help them alleviate their stress and built-up anxiety. Thus, I aimed for a minimalist, cute and aesthetically pleasing visuals in order to create this simulation. I also use a stylized typeface, Playfair Display, to offer a sense delicacy. Not to mention, I decided to incorporate a few serene and playful background music inspiring users to achieve a wholesome experience.  

<b>Coding Challenges</b>

I have encounter countless coding challenges, where I had to debug by myself and, when I did everything I could thought of, I had to ask for help to spot the error that I could not have spotted since I stared at my code for so long. Accordingly, for most of the debugging sessions, it was tiny errors, such as typos or the wrong symbols for Javascript operators.

There were three most challenging codes that I had to incorporated in my project. The first is to incorporate Craig Reynolds' Flocking code example, taken from one of p5 Examples pages. The code seemed to be difficult to understand at first but I understood most of it as I analyzed it thoroughly. Consequently, it was challenging to figure out the x and y positions of the "boids" to change the display parameters as they were created with p5.Vector, as it is a content that I have yet to learn. However, I managed to troubleshoot it with the help of teachers, teaching assistants and peers.

The second challenge was to incorporate sound in my project as it is a content that I have difficulty to understand as it requires the knowledge of mathematics and physics to be able to manipulated it. For example, I did try to code oscillation and polysynth for my simulation but I had too much trouble understanding how it works so I dropped it. That being so, I also thought that p5.Oscillator and p5.Polysynth did not match the concept of my project so I reflect on the sound aspect of my project and I found that background music matched well with what I want users to experience. Despite the fact that I want to code my own sound for this simulation, I found that it is better to use sound effects and audio files to express the enjoyable atmosphere.

The third coding challenge is the debugging process. I find that it quite laborious to debug codes that has invisible errors. What I mean by invisible is errors that do not show on the console, meaning that the code makes sense according to the program but it will not run properly as the code is not using the appropriate terms or so. For instance, it took me 11 hours before finding out that it was a tiny error by inputting "===" rather than "=" in the if statement. This took a lot of my time and it is quite frustrating when I discover these tiny errors. However, it is quite rewarding and relieving because I found the error and I can now move on to code the next steps for my simulation.
