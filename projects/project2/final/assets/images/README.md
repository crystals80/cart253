# Images folder

This is the folder where you would keep all the images associated with your project, such as `.png`, `.jpg`, and other formats. An example image, `clown.png`, is here in case you need something to play around with.

All images are in `.png` or `.jpg` formats. GIFs are in `.gif`. As stated in the assets folder, all images are from flaticon.com and vectorstock.com. Some GIFs are from a blog and dribble.com

That said, these visual media have been edited via Photoshop for the desired visuals of the project. There is no intention of infringement or such thing as this is a school project (CC)
